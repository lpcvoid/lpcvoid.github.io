-------------------------

Ever since I moved my main computing environment over to a desktop at the start of the pandemic (which by now is already like 70 years ago, time flies man), I have 
regretted not being mobile anymore - even if that means sitting on the sofa instead of somewhere outside.

So, a few weeks ago, I started looking for a laptop. I wanted something small-ish, max 14 inch. It shall have a 1080p display, since I can't stand the waste of
energy and problems with nonstandard DPI with these high resolution but small displays. I wanted it to have at least DDR4 RAM, since I had some laying around. Also,
I personally find Thunderbolt support really important, for those situations where I do want to connect it to my docking station. 
This also implies that I want USB-C power delivery, which makes the docking situation less painful, and also makes it possible to only carry around a small
charger which can at the same time charge my phone. Oh, and I didn't want an [Nvidia](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OF_5EKNX0Eg) GPU, 
since they don't offer open source drivers and [Sway](https://swaywm.org) doesn't support anything proprietary, which is a good thing. So, ideally Intel, because I never 
had any problems with `i915`.

So, with all these criterias set, long story short I settled on a Dell Latitude 7390. The decision was actually easy - I just searched through used laptops on Ebay, while
ignoring the Thinkpad series (I cannot stand their swapping of fn and ctrl [I know you can remap it, but still]). Also, HP Elitebooks where way more expensive than Dell
Latitudes. I paid 271 EUR for the following configuration:

So, I got a 8. Gen i5, 16GB RAM, and Thunderbolt - and even a touchscreen. Pretty good deal! 
And I can report that eveything (Audio, Webcam, Touchscreen, USB ports, Thunderbolt) works with Debian 11 (Kernel 5.10).

Just one problem...

### Keyboard swap

The Keyboard was the [German QWERTZ layout](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_keyboard_layout). I can touch type ANSI-US QWERTY without really caring all too 
much about the layout, but it still annoyed the hell out of me. So I looked at other pictures of internals of the laptop, with the plan to do a swap of the keyboard.
The good news first: yes, it's possible, but you need to take care which keyboard you buy.

You need two things: an upper palmrest, which is one large plastic frame with the correct keyboard cutout, and the keyboard itself.

<img src="https://lpcvoid.com/img/laptop/palmrest_bottom.jpg" style="max-height: 400px; max-width: 400px;"/>

The palmrest was the hardest part, and I was lucky - only a single seller was selling one. The keyboard seemed easier, loads of ANSI US keyboards on eBay. 
But I had to try two until I found one that actually works completely, as the Windows/Super key wasn't working on the first one. If you're ever in the same situation,
here's the exact model I used:

It's a bit annoying to take it all apart, but be careful with the ribbons (and don't strip any screws!), and you'll be fine.

### All in all...

... a very good laptop. Everything works, battery lasts forever and display is great. I can absolutely recommend this setup. It's rugged enough for throwing it into
a bag, and beefy enough for compiling code.
