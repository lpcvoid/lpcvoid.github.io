                <p><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS">CORS</a> is one of those things that I think are needed, important, and annoying at the same time. I am happy it exists, because it protects against a certain class of attacks where a website can &quot;pretend&quot; to be you and request third-party resources in your name. But it&#x27;s also a bit annoying, specially when things that <em>should</em> work, don&#x27;t. This blog post is short, but if it helps a single person on planet earth, then it has done its deed.</p>
<p>Imagine a web application which consists of many different endpoints (as most do). You secured one of them with <a href="https://lpcvoid.com/blog/0010_private_ca_client_certificates/index.html">TLS client auth</a> - also called mTLS.</p>
<p>Now, another web application on a different subdomain, requests (via GET) this resource on the client (browser) side. You anticipate this, and enable CORS headers on the protected endpoint.</p>
<pre><code>add_header &#x27;Access-Control-Allow-Origin&#x27; &#x27;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;$URL&#x27; always;
add_header &#x27;Access-Control-Allow-Credentials&#x27; &#x27;true&#x27;;
add_header &#x27;Access-Control-Allow-Methods&#x27; &#x27;GET, POST, OPTIONS&#x27;;</code></pre>
<p>Sweet, that should do it, right? Trembling with anticipation, you refresh the page of the web application which requests this URL, only for Firefox to greet you with:</p>
<pre><code>HTTP&#x2F;1.1 403 Forbidden
Server: nginx
Date: Sun, 14 Apr 2024 18:02:33 GMT
Content-Type: text&#x2F;html; charset=utf-8
Content-Length: 146
Connection: keep-alive</code></pre>
<p>No CORS headers, and a 403. What&#x27;s up with that? Turns out (after a while of debugging, as usual) that the CORS &quot;pre-flight&quot; check failed. This is an OPTIONS request toward the URL in question, in which the browser checks for the headers above. The problem is that this request doesn&#x27;t support mTLS authentication! As an added bonus, there&#x27;s a ten year old <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1019603">Firefox bug</a> about this behavior. To be fair, this seems to be an oversight in the CORS spec itself, and not in Firefox.</p>
<p>Anyhow, you can fix all of this by setting an about:config property <code>network.cors_preflight.allow_client_cert</code> to <code>true</code>. </p>
<p>After this, your CORS requests will use mTLS authenticated pre-flight requests to obtain the Access-Control-Allow-* headers, and Bob&#x27;s your uncle.</p>
