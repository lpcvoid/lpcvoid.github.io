                <p>Looking back, my blogposts mostly revolve aroud complaining about things I dislike. There are also many things to like out there, so this post is dedicated to that: software I use often, love, and want to recommend to others.</p>
<h3 id="sway">Sway</h3>
<p>After some years of using GNOME as my primary desktop environment, I tried <a href="https://swaywm.org/">Sway</a>. You know that feeling when you try something new,
and it instantly hits that sweet spot of being both intuitive and feeling <em>right</em>? That&#x27;s Sway for me. I love how lightweight it is, the fact that it&#x27;s
running on Wayland so multiple displays with different resoultions aren&#x27;t painful anymore, and the best part: it&#x27;s highly configurable. I&#x27;ll upload my config somewhere
soon.</p>
<p>I recommend running it together with <code>swaylock</code> and <code>waybar</code>.</p>
<h3 id="sqlite">SQLite</h3>
<p>Whenever I have a situation within some project of mine where I need to save some data on disk, 9&#x2F;10 times I use sqlite. It&#x27;s fast, has bindings for every language
under the sun, well documented (the <a href="https://www.sqlite.org/docs.html">documentation</a> is interesting enough to be read like a book, IMHO) and <a href="https://www.sqlite.org/mostdeployed.html">battle tested</a>.</p>
<p>Next time you need to save some data - consider joining the fan club.</p>
<h3 id="fish">fish</h3>
<p>The first thing I do whenever I set up a new computer is install the fish shell. I have nothing against bash, in fact you can tune it to have a lot of the features that
fish has out of the box, but that&#x27;s the problem, I am lazy. Fish has a very good command history, and the built-in git support is amazing. </p>
<h3 id="thunderbird">Thunderbird</h3>
<p>I love Email in general. Open standard, widely supported, text first. Thunderbird brings a lot to the table - besides e-mail, it can also be used as an RSS reader, which
is my primary method of consuming news (...along with a rather large list of RSS filters - never having to read something about Elon Musk again by itself is already worth it).</p>
<h3 id="kde-okular">KDE Okular</h3>
<p>Okular is a document viewer. I use it to read (and edit!) PDFs. It is snappy, doesn&#x27;t annoy me, and is open source (okay, everything on this list is, but still!). Also,
did you know that it&#x27;s the first piece of software which is <a href="https://www.blauer-engel.de/en/products/kde-okular">certified</a> by &quot;Blauer Engel&quot; (a German Eco label) as being &quot;Energy efficient&quot;?
Their testing methology looks decent. I bet we won&#x27;t see any Electron stuff on that list anytime soon (and not on this list either).</p>
<h3 id="firefox">Firefox</h3>
<p>If this list where sorted by popularity, then Firefox would probably be a lot higher, but it isn&#x27;t, so it&#x27;s down here. Firefox is fantastic software. Mozilla,
the parent company, wasn&#x27;t always without missteps. 
We had the <a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/privacy/mozilla-investigates-mr-robot-firefox-extension-problem/">Mr. Robot marketing thing</a>, which was a pretty big WTF moment for me.
Or the <a href="https://calpaterson.com/mozilla.html">funny graph</a> about their CEO making more money while Firefox user numbers tanked. But all in all, I feel like they are doing
their best in a hypercommercialized world to stay afloat, while building an absolutely amazing piece of very complex technology.</p>
<h3 id="rclone">Rclone</h3>
<p>I use Rclone for backing up data (using cron for managing backup times). It supports <a href="https://rclone.org/#providers">many backends</a>, even though I only use it with sftp.
I especially love that I can layer backends. For example, Rclone allows to layer a crypto backend onto an sftp backend, so that any file operation is automatically encrypted.
If you&#x27;re looking for some backup solution - seriously consider Rclone + cron.</p>
